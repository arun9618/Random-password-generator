# Random-password-generator
This is a Python script that generates random passwords based on user-specified parameters.

# Requirements
This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your system. There are no other dependencies.

# Usage
To use the script, simply run the random_password_generator.py file with Python:
python random_password_generator.py

# The script will then prompt you for the following information:

Password length: How many characters long you want your password to be.
Use lowercase letters? (y/n): Whether to include lowercase letters in the password.
Use uppercase letters? (y/n): Whether to include uppercase letters in the password.
Use numbers? (y/n): Whether to include numbers in the password.
Use symbols? (y/n): Whether to include symbols (such as !, @, and #) in the password.
After you've provided this information, the script will generate a random password that meets your criteria and print it to the console.



# Here's a possible algorithm for a random password generator:

Define the possible characters that can be used in the password. This can include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Prompt the user for the desired length of the password.
Prompt the user for which types of characters to include in the password (e.g. lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, symbols).
Based on the user's selections, create a list of possible characters to use in the password.
Generate a password by randomly selecting characters from the list of possible characters.
Repeat step 5 until the desired length of the password is reached.
Return the generated password.
Here's a sample Python code implementing the above algorithm:
